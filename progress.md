- Receiving initial skeleton from Roi
- Total 0f 12 hours

Week 4-5 13/11/2022 - 26/11/2022

- Research about OpenGL
- Research about .frag files
- Total of 6 hours

Week 6: 27/11/2022 - 03/12/2022

- Beginning shader - can't find this file at this point
- Total of 8 hours

Week 7: 04/12/2022 - 10/12/2022

- Changing strategy to focus on adjacency calculation
- Changing tiny obj file in order to get faces vector
- Total of 10 hours

Week 8: 11/12/2022 - 17/12/2022

- Calculating adjacency, storing in vector
- Checking correctness of adjacency calculation
- Finishing draft of shader

- Fixing inheritance problems
- Passing data correctly between vertex, geometry, fragment shader
- Total of 12 hours

Week 10: 25/12/2022 - 31/12/2022

- Trying to understand the source of the problem.
- Total of 10 hours

Week 11: 01/01/2023 - 07/01/2023

- We fixed the problem - drawing only lines at this point.
- New bug: the lines don't correspond with the correct shape of the object. Searching how to solve this.

07/02/2023:

- Testing silhouette on a number of objects
- Recording videos of silhouette models - the videos have been transfered to the README file 

Week 15: 13/02/2023 - 20/02/20203
